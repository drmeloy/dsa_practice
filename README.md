Practicing DSA

4.3: Lists of Depths
  - Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists)

10.2 Group Anagrams
  - Write a method to sort an array of strings so that all the anagrams are next to each other.

Tries
  - Given a list of string str[] and a prefix string pre. The task is to count the number of words in list of string with given prefix using trie. STRETCH GOAL: Return the words that use the prefix.
  - Example:
    - Input: str = [ “apk”, “app”, “apple”, “arp”, “array” ], pre = “ap”
    - Output: 3
    - Input: str = [ “gee”, “geek”, “geezer”, “geeksforgeeks”, “geekiness”, “geekgod” ], pre = “geek”
    - Output: 4
